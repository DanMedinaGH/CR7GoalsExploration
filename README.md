# Overview
Cristiano Ronaldo/CR7 is widely considered the best player in soccer history, along with Lionel Messi. The main argument
people use to validate this is due to his goal-scoring ability and saying it is better than Messi's.

# Objective
Explore CR7 European club goals in order to collect different metrics showcasing CR7's impressive goal-scoring ability.<br/>
Key metrics collected will be used in a future project to compare with Lionel Messi's goal-scoring ability.

# Action
First, I used T-SQL to discover different patterns and trends in CR7's european club goals. <br/>
These patterns will then be used to create key metrics to emphasize CR7's goalscoring abilities to compare with Lionel Messi <br/>
